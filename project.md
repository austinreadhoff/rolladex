## Backlog

### PF2E
- "Add to Spellbook" logic should be different from 5e to account for duplicate prepped spells in slots.  Maybe even separate spontaneous/prepared UX?  Whole spell list should be probably be rethought
- Replace parens in spell names, to allow more spell note delimiters (fix spells.ts and character.hasSpell, see 5e)
    - Remove link text from spells as well
- Action icons 
- Shield HP bar changes color when broken

### 5E
- Show a count of how many spells are currently prepared
- Signify spellbook spells using icon in catalog list
- Remove from spellbook button in catalog

### Both Games
- Rethink viewing descriptions in spellbook

### Nitpicks/Tweaks/Visuals
- fancy bars slight text offset
- Less ugly pdf export (including not showing the cursor)
- tooltips to show work for calculated fields, like ability checks
- Inconsistent 5e spell description formatting

### App Mgmt
- Automatic updates
- Is it possible to update content w/o version update?
- Uppercase the app name (windows and linux)

### High Effort, Low Demand
- gm tools: monster reference
    - integrate with turn tracker
- Character Pictures (how to store?)
- Non-PITA method of showing unsaved status in title bar
- Custom undo stack
- Roll dice from sheet by clicking on things
    - Abilities, save, skills, attacks, spells(?)
- Command Palatte
    - Roll abilities/skills/saves
    - Rests
    - Cast Spells
    - Make attacks
    - etc?
